/** \brief This class extends HdbExtractor and implements HdbExtractorListener in order to
 *         provide a high level object capable of fetching data from a database and handing
 *         it to the user by means of a pattern familiar to Qt programmers.
 *
 * Signals are emitted during extraction progress and when data fetch finishes.
 * There are signals transmitting the progress of the extraction and signals
 * carrying the extracted data, partial or as a whole.
 * It is safe to connect the signals emitted by QHdbextractorProxy to the main thread
 * of your application (the UI thread). QHdbextractorProxy takes care of emitting the
 * signals in the main thread of QApplication. This means that the default Qt DirectConnection
 * can be used in signal/slot connections.
