<ul>
    <li>The TANGO archiving system is a tool allowing TANGO users to store the readings coming
    from a TANGO based control system into a database.
    <li>The archived data are essential for the day by day operation of complex
    scientific facilities for instance.
    <li>They can be used for long term monitoring of subsystems, statistics, parameters correlation
    or comparison of operating setups over time.
    <li>To take advantage of the fast and lightweight event-driven communication provided
    by TANGO release 8 with the adoption of ZeroMQ, a novel archiving system for
    the TANGO Controls framework, named HDB++, has been designed and developed,
    resulting from a collaboration between Elettra and ESRF at the beginning.
    <li>HDB++ design allows TANGO users to store data with microsecond timestamp resolution
    into traditional database management systems such as MySQL or into NoSQL databases
    such as Apache Cassandra.
